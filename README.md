<h1>Flappy Bird Clone</h1>

<p>This project is a simple clone of the classic game Flappy Bird, created following the tutorial videos by "Dev Soutinho." The game is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

The game ends if the bird collides with any of the pipes or hits the ground.</p>
